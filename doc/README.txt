IMPORTANT NOTE: See C:\Source\hg\tags\graphs_0.6\etc (on truck) for existing
documentation.

NOTE: There may be useful data in the jots.

NOTE: There may be also useful data in the old daily status notes (although I
doubt it).


I'll need at least two directories here, one for jotted notes (jots) and one
for documentation to be released.
