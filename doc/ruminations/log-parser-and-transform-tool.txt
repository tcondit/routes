I've got a big problem with my agents data.  It's not in a analysis-friendly
format.  It's all log files.  The logs are great, but they are chronologically
linear, meaning they are based on events in the order in which they occur.

(later that day...)

So this is nonsense.  I've got (almost) everything I need for collecting time
data about the Fares right in the Fare class.  The only thing that would be
tough to get is data about which Taxis are competing for a specific Fare in
the compete simulations.

Collecting data about the Taxis is another matter.  I'm going to have to do
some work to get that, but it shouldn't be too bad, just different.  The Taxis
can tell me who they are competing for in a given simulation and I can
cross-reference it against the Fare data to get the missing piece for the
Fares.

[By the way: I *loathe* the term "cross-reference" and don't think I've ever
had reason to use it before today.]


Fares: see self.ts['this-n-that'] in class Fare

Taxis: What kind of data do I want?  Is it different depending on whether it's
  a cooperate or compete sim?  Should the Taxis in the cooperate sims
  acknowledge the Fare request?  Some of the things that would be good to
  collect are:
    * Is this a local, regional or global broadcast?
    * Am I competing for a Fare?  Who else is competing for the same Fare?
    * If I am competing for a Fare, did I get it?  What percentage of the
      Fares that I competed for did I get?  (These values should (?) add to
      100%.)
    * What is my origin?  How far have I driven?
    * How much of my driving is productive?  This only makes sense in a
      competitive sim.  The ratio is (distance driven to Fare and to Fare's
      destination) divided by (total distance driven).  This gets at the
      question of how much driving was wasted because another Taxi got the
      Fare.
