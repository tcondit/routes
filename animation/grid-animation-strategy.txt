grid animation strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. draw a 10x10 grid
2. add an Agent somewhere on the grid, draw again
3. move the Agent to an adjacent point, draw again
4. repeat steps 2 and 3 100 times, save figures
5. make movie




animation data strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. use 1 decimal place, collect location for every Agent 10/unit
2. come up with a simple key:value pair format for recording Agent locations
3. STOP and make sure I can get no. 2 into matplotlib before going any further
    - in particular, how to overlay Agent icons onto an existing graph?
